# AlphaCRC web test

A test project for testing my capabilities


# PhoneCentre
 The project was created using the Visual Studio C# Wep Api + ReactJs Template

## Project Startup:

 When the project is started, it will generate a SQlite database and generate its data in the CallerDb class

## Possible errors with the project:

   * Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json » eslint-config-react-app » ........
   
   To fix this problem, it is neccasary to go into ClientApp, find the package.json file and re-save it. Afterwards problem should be gone. This problem happens only on Windows.
